                        <ul>A passionate hobby of mine, creative writing is how I profess the machinations of my mind. 
                            <br>My style tends more to the dialogues of the mind and thoughts, as I find myself exploring the 
                            <br>Psychological/Surrealism genres with my work. However, across short stories, novella's and more, 
                            <br>I intend to never stop exploring the forms and functions of creative expression throuh writing.

                        <ul>A creative writers greatest strength is in their ability and wililngness to read; this is 
                            <br>something I wholeheartedly believe to be true, and as such I make it my goal to be deliberate 
                            <br>in my readings of narratives of all forms. As someone taken by Video Games as a narrative form, 
                            <br>I often find myself wishing to express where in these texts I find myself uniquely touched or 
                            <br>moved - this has lead to the development of written and video-form essays on some of my 
                            <br>favourite narrative experiences.
                            <li><span>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - To Deny a Legacy</span><br>The world of Termina, doomed to fall by the whims of an ancient evil 
                                <br>and the all consuming moon they conjure, has only one saviour, on hero. But, in a world where 
                                <br>none know his name or his deeds, did this hero ever really exist?</li>
                            <li><span>Sonic Frontiers - Finding Your Flame</span><br>Sonic Frontiers is a game of many narratives - a narrative of success as 
                                <br>a well received and supported modern sonic game; a narrative of isolation, struggling against 
                                <br>vulnerability and weakness to find the strength to fight on; and a narrative of exploration and 
                                <br>discovery, as an open world sonic experience. But for me, Sonic Frontiers is best viewed as a 
                                <br>narrative about the facets of identity. Sonic and his friends feel, see and learn a lot during 
                                <br>their adventures across the Starfall Islands - most importantly, they learn what it really means 
                                <br>to Find Your Flame.</li>

                        <ul>Having deployed myself towards video essays, I've found myself falling for the creative 
                            <br>expression found in video editing - a passion that has not gone unnoticed. With the skills 
                            <br>developed in personal projects, I have begun taking on some freelance video editing work for 
                            <br>some amazing creators who just need an extra push to see their creative visions through!
